There are plenty of good Arduino Grade Xing sketches. This board supports one by Jon Schmidt which uses the Nano's 8
analog inputs to monitor up 4 sets of sensors. It drives 2 servos for the crossing gates, 2 phases of LEDs
for the flashing lights and an output to drive a crossing bell sound module, like the ones from our friends
at Iowa Scaled Engineering.
